# got-link-prediction
TBD


### Notes (temporary subsection)
- https://deathtimeline.com/ contains all the character deaths for the first 6 seasons
- how to represent non-ordinary deaths (e.g. "Dragged behind a Horse")? Do we even take those (need to see how big the network is with and without those nodes)?
- rough plan (not fixed!): test some classical link prediction methods (e.g. Adamic-Adar) solo; test hand-crafted features in combination with more complex classifiers; test combination of both of those -> *on GoT deaths network*  
- possibly useful dataset for augmenting ours: https://github.com/jeffreylancaster/game-of-thrones/tree/master/data
